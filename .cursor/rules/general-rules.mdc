- allways follow best practices, keep code modular and maintainable
- when implementing UI allways do your best to make it look modern and consistent, use atomic design where possible

- for each new task create feature branch, make frequent commits.
- dont be lazy, never ask me to run/test something you can do yourself with tool calling
- use 'npm test' in root project directory to check if something is broken,'npm lint' for any linter issues, 'npm run dev' to run whole project
